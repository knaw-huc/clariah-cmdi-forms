# CLARIAH CMDI Forms
*Tweak Your CMDI Forms to the Max*

This repository will soon contain the implementation of CCF (CLARIAH CMDI Forms). CCF creates a form in your browser to create or update metadata records. These forms are based on the [Component Metadata](http://www.clarin.eu/cmdi/) profiles. However, often these profiles don't contain enough information to create an end user friendly form. To overcome this CCF supports various tweaks, many based on features which have become available in [CMDI 1.2](https://www.clarin.eu/cmdi1.2). CCF is implemented using PHP and JavaScript. By implementing some PHP classes it will be possible to embed CCF in your own CMDI environment.
